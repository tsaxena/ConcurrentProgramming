ConcurrentProgramming
=====================
 Implemented a concurrent version of the Sudoku solver using Java concurrent
library. Implemented multiple strategies to parallelize the solver such that each thread to work on a smaller
search space in parallel and minimizes the execution time, leading to a solution faster. Used semaphores, locks,
monitors, message passing to allow a set of threads to work on smaller search spaces in parallel.
